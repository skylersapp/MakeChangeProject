### **Overview**

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

### **User Stories**

	---User Story #1---
	The user is prompted asking for the price of the item.

	---User Story #2---
	The user is then prompted asking how much money was tendered by the customer.

	---User Story #3---
	Display an appropriate message if the customer provided too little money or the exact amount.

	---User Story #4---
	If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, display the number of bills 
	and coins that should be given to the customer.

### **Concepts**

	* While loops
	* If/Else statements
	* Math.floor();
	* Math.round();
	* use of multiple Methods
	* use of static field variables
	* use of objects

### **Technologies Used**

	* Eclipse IDE
	* Apple MacBook Pro
	* Terminal 
	* GitHub
	

### **Challenges**
	
	It was difficult for me to figure out how to appropriately get the coins to display at the end of the program. Getting the change to display straightforward, but for some reason my brain just struggled
	with getting the denominations to display correctly. 
	
	Another major challenge was succumbing to a severe migraine headache that lasted for muultiple days. This challenge was not easily overcome and resulted in less-than-optimal coding. 

### **Lessons Learned**
	
	* Get done quickly and early. Always sprint when possible because you never know what issues your health might present you with and whether or not you'll make your deadline. 
	* Keeping large code blocks split between multiple methods helps in both organization as well as readibility. This greatly makes debugging easier as you write your code and as you refactor. 
	* It doesn't hurt to ask for help sooner than later. It does, however, hurt to handicap yourself by waiting.
